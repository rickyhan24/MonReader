# MonReader

In this project, I perform image and video analysis to help automate the process of document digitization.  Images of book pages being flipped or not flipped are classified using a traditional convolutional neural network and a fine-tuned pretrained model Resnet50.  Videos in the form of a sequence of frames are classified as flipping or not flipping using a combination of a CNN and LSTM.  These analyses play a role in the capability of a mobile app, MonReader, to automatically detect and capture images of the pages of a book as they are being flipped.  This can improve the ease with which users of the app can scan documents compared to traditional means of scanning documents.
